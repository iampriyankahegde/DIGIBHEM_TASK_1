Random Number Guessing Game
 Working:
     I have created a Java program that generates a random number between a specified range(i.e 1-100).
     User will have 5 attempts to guess the number.
     If the number guessed by user is correct program will display correct message 
     otherwise  gives the feedback that the guessed number is less than or greater than the random number
     Also it will give option to replay.
